## Use action groups to define actions for your agent to perform

An action group defines actions that the agent can help the user perform. For example, you could define an action group called BookHotel that helps users carry out actions that you can define such as:

  - CreateBooking – Helps users book a hotel.

  - GetBooking – Helps users get information about a hotel they booked.

  - CancelBooking – Helps users cancel a booking.

You create an action group by performing the following steps:

  1. Define the parameters and information that the agent must elicit from the user for each action in the action group to be carried out.

  2. Decide how the agent handles the parameters and information that it receives from the user and where it sends the information it elicits from the user.
